# Navier-Stokes spectral solver for 2D-incompressible flows

## Requirements :

- Python 3.6 or higher (usage of fstrings)
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scipy
- Vtk
- tkdm


## Short description

This program is a solver for the Navier-Stokes equations in 2D incompressible flows. It relies on spectral decomposition to compute derivatives using the fast Fourrier transform algorithm implemented in numpy. A first-order discretization scheme is applied for time integration.

The code is intended for training purposes and serves as a first step toward developing more comprehensive solvers.


## Features

### Obstacle initialization

The obstacle is modeled using the immersed boundary method. In the code, the obstacle geometry is declared in the *masque* 2D array in the *Forces ext√©rieures* section. 

### Post-processing

Every 1000 iterations an XML-formated vti file is generated for post-processing with Paraview.


## Limitations 

A dealiasing filter is applied when solving the non-linear term. As a result, small-scale phenomena are not fully resolved.

The use of spectral methods necessitates periodic boundary conditions at the domain's external boundaries. To mitigate the undesired effects of this model, several buffers are implemented near these boundaries.
